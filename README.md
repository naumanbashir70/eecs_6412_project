# CycleGAN with Transformer Block

We have provided the code (Notebooks) for:
#### 1. Pix2pix GAN
#### 2. Cycle GAN
#### 3. Cycle GAN with Transformer Block

#### **1 Dataset** 
    # To train and evaluated the models we used the BraTS 2023 dataset:
    # The original 3D dataset can be downloaded from here: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn51156910/wiki/622351
    # The 2D data which we used in our model can be downloaded from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hXJ8CP6BgJz2bFM1OF2LmGtc3VvRgZhS/view?usp=sharing

#### **2 How to Run**
    # Inside the notebooks, there are separate cells for
    # 1. Preprocessing
    # 2. Training
    # 3. Testing
